# 4X Plus Plus
## Current Version: null

**4X Plus Plus** (or **4XPP**) is a stupid little 4X game written in c++ and rendered in Visual Studio Code's terminal, or any terminal that can print extended ASCII. Not compatiable with MacOS, iOS, Linux, or Android, because I'm too lazy to do something like that.

## Requirements
* [MinGW-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/7.3.0/threads-posix/dwarf/i686-7.3.0-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0.7z/download);
